"This is the 2nd 32 inch smart LG TV I am buying the first one stopped working after 3 months some issue with the electrical adaptor. After 3 months of no response from LG customer care I thought its easier to buy a new TV. Made the mistake picked up the same TV thinking the previous may be one off. The new TV LG customer care came and installed the audio was not working they blamed the tata sky set top box and said get it fixed. Now tata sky technicians came and validated that their settop box audio is perfectly fine on other TV and this LG 32 TV has a issue. Big disappointment 2 times on amazon two times defective model was shipped. Not sure what's the issue but definitely makes online shopping experience bad. Totally disappointing please donot by LG products they seem to have overgrown the trust they once held

"It is probably the best budget smart TV around with a brand name. I have been using it for about a month now and my thoughts are belowThe best thing about this product is it's price but don't buy it if you are looking for a premium product. The low points of the product is highlighted below1) Sound quality is not good if you are planning to place the TV in the living room I will suggest you add a speaker for clarity2) the smart features are not impressive with no screen cast support for Android .The web browser UI is not ideal but manageable.3) the remote for this TV is not best built with a very long sequence required to increase brightness or picture quality. Also the absence of YouTube button is also not convenient.

"I'm using it from Feb 3, 2019.  This is a very nice product from LG. This product is a 2017 model and that is why price is very reasonable. But I think It hardly matters whether it is  2017 or 2018 model. I asked at LG showroom, they told the price will be around 28k. But I got it from Amazon in 21k.Smart features are working nicely . Youtube app, Netflix and Amazon Prime app is working fine . But after Tv installation these apps might ask for upgradation. So You need to updated all apps after connecting wifi or LAN connection. Web browser of this TV is quite good. U can open any website through this browser. But might take little longer to  load any video streaming website!!I'm using my broadband wifi and it has connected properly.  LAN cable option is also there. TV has a good user manual app installed in it by which you can easily find out how to use this TV. this is very helpful.Miracast screen share option is quite effective for this TV. You need to install an app from Play store in your Smartphone. And need to register your TV with serial No in this APP. and then you can share your mobile's galley, videos etc in the TV. But remember you can't able to copy files or folders from your mobile to TV. Only You can share the screen.This TV does not comes with a magic remote!Overall TV is very good for my use. I would recommend this product.

"Picture is bit tinted, whites are not pure white. Overall very average picture quality, not expected from reputed brand like LG.  Or perhaps that's because it's HD ready, not full HD. Connectivity options are good. USB plays almost all video audio formats. Casting mobile screen is not very smooth even though I have 300 Mbps wifi router, video stutters and lags.

After 3 months of no response from LG customer care I thought its easier to buy a new TV. Made the mistake picked up the same TV thinking the previous may be one off. The new TV LG customer care came and installed the audio was not working they blamed the tata sky set top box and said get it fixed. Now tata sky technicians came and validated that their settop box audio is perfectly fine on other TV and this LG 32 TV has a issue. Big disappointment 2 times on amazon two times defective model was shipped. Not sure what's the issue but definitely makes online shopping experience bad.

"I'm using it from Feb 3, 2019.  This is a very nice product from LG. This product is a 2017 model and that is why price is very reasonable. But I think It hardly matters whether it is  2017 or 2018 model. I asked at LG showroom, they told the price will be around 28k. But I got it from Amazon in 21k.Smart features are working nicely . Youtube app, Netflix and Amazon Prime app is working fine . But after Tv installation these apps might ask for upgradation. So You need to updated all apps after connecting wifi or LAN connection. Web browser of this TV is quite good. U can open any website through this browser. But might take little longer to  load any video streaming website!!I'm using my broadband wifi and it has connected properly.  LAN cable option is also there. TV has a good user manual app installed in it by which you can easily find out how to use this TV. this is very helpful.Miracast screen share option is quite effective for this TV. You need to install an app from Play store in your Smartphone. And need to register your TV with serial No in this APP. and then you can share your mobile's galley, videos etc in the TV. But remember you can't able to copy files or folders from your mobile to TV. Only You can share the screen.This TV does not comes with a magic remote!Overall TV is very good for my use.
