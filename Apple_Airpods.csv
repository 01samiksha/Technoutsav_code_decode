"Overall Build Quality is awesome I accidentally dropped it sometimes but these airpods are made up with hard plastic so they won't break easily. And each airpods weight only 4 grams so they damage themselves when dropped from a height as they are so lightweight to cause any damage. If you use an external case like I have then that will be good for outer protection from scratches and drops plus it looks cool though.Talking about battery life again it is solid If you are a casual listener they can last up to 3 days if you listen 6-8 hrs daily.and finally, the sound quality its good but not that good which you get from the in-ear earphone but as you know in-ear earphone are not that comfortable, it has a strong base and high mids so you won't be disappointed by the music quality.

"Wow!!! These are the best accessories which I have used with my iPhone. I do not know what magic has apple done with the W1 chip but boy oh boy that make these so easy to pair with the iPhone, lighting fast. The sound quality is okayish. Not too much base and at times the clarity is also not very good. The battery life of these are also great and the charging case improves it further. The charging speed of these are also very good. They charge very quickly. These are also very easy to carry. These fit my ears perfectly but this might not be for everybody as they come in one size only. Also these are very comfortable .The ear detection works 100% of the time, making this a joy to use with apple devices. The tap commands on the AirPods also work great. But the AirPods  are neither noise cancelling nor water resistant. I have not used these with android so cannot comment on that.

"I have been using this airpods since a month and writing my review now i really like how it paired with iphone not tried with any other phone yet. Frankly its a delicate product i dont know about the durability. Sound quality is good come on its apple and you are paying 12k, but it could have been better with more bass. Battery life is pretty decent but one side of the airpod gets discharge fast then both i dont know its a faulty product or it happens with everyone. For noise cancellation i haven’t check properly while on calling other side of the person i didnt find any problem while talking through airpods. And for music noise cancellation is decent i wont say very good but decent it is. Now talk about stratches even if you put in your pocket gently you can see scratches after few uses. I dont know about silicon cases available and selling on amazon works well or not because i didnt try. Also i dont like to put apple products with cases. Finally in your initial days of using u will feel irritating after long use i would say 2 3 hours of continous use. Pro tip: moisterize your ears with  good moisterizer (little quantity) if your are planning to use for long. Ok guys thats it for now i hope this review will others to choose this product.

"Have been using it from 2 months, One of the best product, sound is just amazing. Battery life is good, it easily lasts for 3 hours & if AirPods battery is low put it in the case for 10 mins it again gains 70-80%. We just need to remove the airpods from the Case and it Auto connects to Iphone smoothly. Got it during Amazon sale period with SBI cashback for 9K, totally worth it.

"Got it this morning and in complete awe of them. This is a pocket size powerhouse. The sound output is insanely good. Wasn't expecting it to be so good, the sound doesn't get distorted even on max volume. They are small, good looking and extremely handy to use. Bluetooth pairing is as easy as it can be.

"Works like a dream. Almost no connectivity issues - very intuitive to use.Sound quality is pretty decent. However it has issues with noise isolation and it’s almost impossible to use in the middle of traffic for example.It’s pretty durable, I’ve had doubts about the durability of the case. Especially because of the small size, but I haven’t had any reason to worry so far.Pretty decent battery life. It’s not as good as my larger over-ear headphones but given the size it’s good. Using it for max of an hour a day, I end up charging it once in two weeks or so.Would I say it’s value for money? No.But if you need a small, easy to carry wireless earphones - this is a pretty good experience. It’s worth it for me.

"I had been meaning to purchase this product for a long time. The delivery took some time but in the end I got it safe and sound. Packaging was done all right. It’s original. The sound quality is good. As I am an existing apple user with 4-5 apple products at home, the AirPods gets synced with all the other products. So connection with them becomes a breeze. The distance is okay. The best thing I have used it in gym and it works flawlessly. It doesn’t fall out of ear while running. It just sticks to your ear. The only issue I find that the sound leaks out of it on increasing the volume.And the most important part, it gets dirty! It’s a dirt magnet. Like even if you don’t use it it gets dirty.I have to referred to some YouTube videos in order to clean my AirPods.Even if you’re a android user, go for it. I have tried it on pixel 2 and it works flawlessly.Rest I leave it on you.

U can track ur airpods also on find my iphone app. I often take bike from metro station to my office which is hardly 5 minutes but the airpods do not fall off. Siri works fine. I think there should be some function to increase the volume bcoz either u have to use ur fone or siri to increror decrease the volume. All in all a good product. I cannot say must buy but yes i am satisfied with the product.

"Amazing product as expected. I'm using it with my Android phone more than iPhone. Excellent coverage, noise cancellation and sound quality. Truly wireless. It takes a little longer to set it up on Android devices, you need to push the button behind the case while setting up on Bluetooth. Once set, works like a charm. Some features are not available on Android, e.g. when you remove the airpods from your ears, music does not stop automatically. Not a deal breaker issue.I strongly recommend this product for use with both iPhone and Android devices.

"Dont buy it from amazon and its seller like Appario Retail Private Ltd. Because when I faced some issue in it then i went apple service center then apple was rejected that this airpod doesnt belongs with us and after i complaint in amazon then they dont care about it. So guys who purchased it olz confirmed with apple that it is original or imported from another country if it is complain in amazon or case on amazon.

"After waiting for so long time I finally got this product. It’s super cool, so small and filled with so many features. Sound quality is like the EarPods, I feel bass I little less.Apart from that design and battery is awesome.It fits perfectly in my ears giving me sufficient battery life to listen to song in single charge.The Connectivity between both AirPods is smooth.Rest assured there is no other product in market compared to this. So fully worth it.

"No compromise in quality. Good base however dsnt fit very well in my ear so had to purchase silicon plugs separately costing abt 800 Rs .

"This is the second time i have purchased the airpods. My wife was so impressed with my earpods that i couldn't stop myself gifting her one. This is the best portable wireless earbuds you can have. Looks little costly for the Indian (myself, one) buyers but if you can stretch your budget don't give a second thought. Base is good, connectivity is top notch. Quite durable, great battery life. Casual music is good. For serious music capability i use my Sony xM1000 (that costs 30K). If i compare Sony and airpods, later is worth the money. Airpods have no match for its price and music capabilities. Cheers!

"when I compare apple AirPods with my Bose soundsport, frankly speaking apple does not hold its ground. But then apple is not a Bose when it comes to earphones, headphones or speakers.Having said that, apple is known for its design and perfection and AirPods look really classy. Sound quality is decent and also have a decent battery life (could be improved on both the fronts though).Fit could have been made a bit better. While Bose soundsport is perfect for gym and outdoor activities, AirPods are not exactly suitable for those.

"Amazing product as expected. I'm using it with my Android phone more than iPhone. Excellent coverage, noise cancellation and sound quality. Truly wireless. It takes a little longer to set it up on Android devices, you need to push the button behind the case while setting up on Bluetooth. Once set, works like a charm. Some features are not available on Android, e.g. when you remove the airpods from your ears, music does not stop automatically.

"This is the second time i have purchased the airpods. My wife was so impressed with my earpods that i couldn't stop myself gifting her one. This is the best portable wireless earbuds you can have. Looks little costly for the Indian (myself, one) buyers but if you can stretch your budget don't give a second thought. Base is good, connectivity is top notch. Quite durable, great battery life. Casual music is good. For serious music capability i use my Sony xM1000 (that costs 30K). If i compare Sony and airpods, later is worth the money. Airpods have no match for its price and music capabilities. Cheers!

"Overall Build Quality is awesome I accidentally dropped it sometimes but these airpods are made up with hard plastic so they won't break easily. And each airpods weight only 4 grams so they damage themselves when dropped from a height as they are so lightweight to cause any damage. If you use an external case like I have then that will be good for outer protection from scratches and drops plus it looks cool though.Talking about battery life again it is solid If you are a casual listener they can last up to 3 days if you listen 6-8 hrs daily.and finally, the sound quality its good but not that good which you get from the in-ear earphone but as you know in-ear earphone are not that comfortable, it has a strong base and high mids so you won't be disappointed by the music quality.

"I have been using this airpods since a month and writing my review now i really like how it paired with iphone not tried with any other phone yet. Frankly its a delicate product i dont know about the durability. Sound quality is good come on its apple and you are paying 12k, but it could have been better with more bass. Battery life is pretty decent but one side of the airpod gets discharge fast then both i dont know its a faulty product or it happens with everyone. For noise cancellation i haven’t check properly while on calling other side of the person i didnt find any problem while talking through airpods. And for music noise cancellation is decent i wont say very good but decent it is. Now talk about stratches even if you put in your pocket gently you can see scratches after few uses. I dont know about silicon cases available and selling on amazon works well or not because i didnt try. Also i dont like to put apple products with cases. Finally in your initial days of using u will feel irritating after long use i would say 2 3 hours of continous use. Pro tip: moisterize your ears with  good moisterizer (little quantity) if your are planning to use for long. Ok guys thats it for now i hope this review will others to choose this product.

"Works like a dream. Almost no connectivity issues - very intuitive to use.Sound quality is pretty decent. However it has issues with noise isolation and it’s almost impossible to use in the middle of traffic for example.It’s pretty durable, I’ve had doubts about the durability of the case. Especially because of the small size, but I haven’t had any reason to worry so far.Pretty decent battery life. It’s not as good as my larger over-ear headphones but given the size it’s good. Using it for max of an hour a day, I end up charging it once in two weeks or so.Would I say it’s value for money? No.But if you need a small, easy to carry wireless earphones - this is a pretty good experience. It’s worth it for me.

"I had been meaning to purchase this product for a long time. The delivery took some time but in the end I got it safe and sound. Packaging was done all right. It’s original. The sound quality is good. As I am an existing apple user with 4-5 apple products at home, the AirPods gets synced with all the other products. So connection with them becomes a breeze. The distance is okay. The best thing I have used it in gym and it works flawlessly. It doesn’t fall out of ear while running. It just sticks to your ear. The only issue I find that the sound leaks out of it on increasing the volume.And the most important part, it gets dirty! It’s a dirt magnet. Like even if you don’t use it it gets dirty.I have to referred to some YouTube videos in order to clean my AirPods.Even if you’re a android user, go for it. I have tried it on pixel 2 and it works flawlessly.Rest I leave it on you.

"Works like a dream. Almost no connectivity issues - very intuitive to use.Sound quality is pretty decent. However it has issues with noise isolation and it’s almost impossible to use in the middle of traffic for example.It’s pretty durable, I’ve had doubts about the durability of the case. Especially because of the small size, but I haven’t had any reason to worry so far.Pretty decent battery life. It’s not as good as my larger over-ear headphones but given the size it’s good. Using it for max of an hour a day, I end up charging it once in two weeks or so.Would I say it’s value for money? No.But if you need a small, easy to carry wireless earphones - this is a pretty good experience. It’s worth it for me.

"I had been meaning to purchase this product for a long time. The delivery took some time but in the end I got it safe and sound. Packaging was done all right. It’s original. The sound quality is good. As I am an existing apple user with 4-5 apple products at home, the AirPods gets synced with all the other products. So connection with them becomes a breeze. The distance is okay. The best thing I have used it in gym and it works flawlessly. It doesn’t fall out of ear while running. It just sticks to your ear. The only issue I find that the sound leaks out of it on increasing the volume.And the most important part, it gets dirty! It’s a dirt magnet. Like even if you don’t use it it gets dirty.I have to referred to some YouTube videos in order to clean my AirPods.Even if you’re a android user, go for it. I have tried it on pixel 2 and it works flawlessly.Rest I leave it on you.

U can track ur airpods also on find my iphone app. I often take bike from metro station to my office which is hardly 5 minutes but the airpods do not fall off. Siri works fine.

Looks little costly for the Indian (myself, one) buyers but if you can stretch your budget don't give a second thought. Base is good, connectivity is top notch. Quite durable, great battery life. Casual music is good. For serious music capability i use my Sony xM1000 (that costs 30K). If i compare Sony and airpods, later is worth the money. Airpods have no match for its price and music capabilities. Cheers!

"Overall Build Quality is awesome I accidentally dropped it sometimes but these airpods are made up with hard plastic so they won't break easily. And each airpods weight only 4 grams so they damage themselves when dropped from a height as they are so lightweight to cause any damage. If you use an external case like I have then that will be good for outer protection from scratches and drops plus it looks cool though.Talking about battery life again it is solid If you are a casual listener they can last up to 3 days if you listen 6-8 hrs daily.and finally, the sound quality its good but not that good which you get from the in-ear earphone but as you know in-ear earphone are not that comfortable, it has a strong base and high mids so you won't be disappointed by the music quality.

I do not know what magic has apple done with the W1 chip but boy oh boy that make these so easy to pair with the iPhone, lighting fast. The sound quality is okayish.

They charge very quickly. These are also very easy to carry. These fit my ears perfectly but this might not be for everybody as they come in one size only. Also these are very comfortable .The ear detection works 100% of the time, making this a joy to use with apple devices. The tap commands on the AirPods also work great. But the AirPods  are neither noise cancelling nor water resistant. I have not used these with android so cannot comment on that.

"I have been using this airpods since a month and writing my review now i really like how it paired with iphone not tried with any other phone yet. Frankly its a delicate product i dont know about the durability. Sound quality is good come on its apple and you are paying 12k, but it could have been better with more bass. Battery life is pretty decent but one side of the airpod gets discharge fast then both i dont know its a faulty product or it happens with everyone. For noise cancellation i haven’t check properly while on calling other side of the person i didnt find any problem while talking through airpods. And for music noise cancellation is decent i wont say very good but decent it is. Now talk about stratches even if you put in your pocket gently you can see scratches after few uses. I dont know about silicon cases available and selling on amazon works well or not because i didnt try. Also i dont like to put apple products with cases. Finally in your initial days of using u will feel irritating after long use i would say 2 3 hours of continous use.

And each airpods weight only 4 grams so they damage themselves when dropped from a height as they are so lightweight to cause any damage. If you use an external case like I have then that will be good for outer protection from scratches and drops plus it looks cool though.Talking about battery life again it is solid If you are a casual listener they can last up to 3 days if you listen 6-8 hrs daily.and finally, the sound quality its good but not that good which you get from the in-ear earphone but as you know in-ear earphone are not that comfortable, it has a strong base and high mids so you won't be disappointed by the music quality.

"Wow!!! These are the best accessories which I have used with my iPhone. I do not know what magic has apple done with the W1 chip but boy oh boy that make these so easy to pair with the iPhone, lighting fast. The sound quality is okayish. Not too much base and at times the clarity is also not very good. The battery life of these are also great and the charging case improves it further. The charging speed of these are also very good. They charge very quickly. These are also very easy to carry. These fit my ears perfectly but this might not be for everybody as they come in one size only. Also these are very comfortable .The ear detection works 100% of the time, making this a joy to use with apple devices. The tap commands on the AirPods also work great. But the AirPods  are neither noise cancelling nor water resistant. I have not used these with android so cannot comment on that.

"I have been using this airpods since a month and writing my review now i really like how it paired with iphone not tried with any other phone yet. Frankly its a delicate product i dont know about the durability. Sound quality is good come on its apple and you are paying 12k, but it could have been better with more bass. Battery life is pretty decent but one side of the airpod gets discharge fast then both i dont know its a faulty product or it happens with everyone. For noise cancellation i haven’t check properly while on calling other side of the person i didnt find any problem while talking through airpods. And for music noise cancellation is decent i wont say very good but decent it is. Now talk about stratches even if you put in your pocket gently you can see scratches after few uses. I dont know about silicon cases available and selling on amazon works well or not because i didnt try. Also i dont like to put apple products with cases. Finally in your initial days of using u will feel irritating after long use i would say 2 3 hours of continous use. Pro tip: moisterize your ears with  good moisterizer (little quantity) if your are planning to use for long. Ok guys thats it for now i hope this review will others to choose this product.

"Works like a dream. Almost no connectivity issues - very intuitive to use.Sound quality is pretty decent. However it has issues with noise isolation and it’s almost impossible to use in the middle of traffic for example.It’s pretty durable, I’ve had doubts about the durability of the case. Especially because of the small size, but I haven’t had any reason to worry so far.Pretty decent battery life. It’s not as good as my larger over-ear headphones but given the size it’s good. Using it for max of an hour a day, I end up charging it once in two weeks or so.Would I say it’s value for money? No.But if you need a small, easy to carry wireless earphones - this is a pretty good experience. It’s worth it for me.

"I had been meaning to purchase this product for a long time. The delivery took some time but in the end I got it safe and sound. Packaging was done all right. It’s original. The sound quality is good. As I am an existing apple user with 4-5 apple products at home, the AirPods gets synced with all the other products. So connection with them becomes a breeze. The distance is okay. The best thing I have used it in gym and it works flawlessly. It doesn’t fall out of ear while running. It just sticks to your ear. The only issue I find that the sound leaks out of it on increasing the volume.And the most important part, it gets dirty! It’s a dirt magnet. Like even if you don’t use it it gets dirty.I have to referred to some YouTube videos in order to clean my AirPods.Even if you’re a android user, go for it. I have tried it on pixel 2 and it works flawlessly.Rest I leave it on you.

U can track ur airpods also on find my iphone app. I often take bike from metro station to my office which is hardly 5 minutes but the airpods do not fall off. Siri works fine. I think there should be some function to increase the volume bcoz either u have to use ur fone or siri to increror decrease the volume. All in all a good product.

"Amazing product as expected. I'm using it with my Android phone more than iPhone. Excellent coverage, noise cancellation and sound quality. Truly wireless. It takes a little longer to set it up on Android devices, you need to push the button behind the case while setting up on Bluetooth. Once set, works like a charm. Some features are not available on Android, e.g. when you remove the airpods from your ears, music does not stop automatically. Not a deal breaker issue.I strongly recommend this product for use with both iPhone and Android devices.

"This is the second time i have purchased the airpods. My wife was so impressed with my earpods that i couldn't stop myself gifting her one. This is the best portable wireless earbuds you can have. Looks little costly for the Indian (myself, one) buyers but if you can stretch your budget don't give a second thought. Base is good, connectivity is top notch. Quite durable, great battery life. Casual music is good. For serious music capability i use my Sony xM1000 (that costs 30K). If i compare Sony and airpods, later is worth the money. Airpods have no match for its price and music capabilities. Cheers!

But then apple is not a Bose when it comes to earphones, headphones or speakers.Having said that, apple is known for its design and perfection and AirPods look really classy. Sound quality is decent and also have a decent battery life (could be improved on both the fronts though).Fit could have been made a bit better. While Bose soundsport is perfect for gym and outdoor activities, AirPods are not exactly suitable for those.

If you use an external case like I have then that will be good for outer protection from scratches and drops plus it looks cool though.Talking about battery life again it is solid If you are a casual listener they can last up to 3 days if you listen 6-8 hrs daily.and finally, the sound quality its good but not that good which you get from the in-ear earphone but as you know in-ear earphone are not that comfortable, it has a strong base and high mids so you won't be disappointed by the music quality.

"Wow!!! These are the best accessories which I have used with my iPhone. I do not know what magic has apple done with the W1 chip but boy oh boy that make these so easy to pair with the iPhone, lighting fast. The sound quality is okayish. Not too much base and at times the clarity is also not very good. The battery life of these are also great and the charging case improves it further. The charging speed of these are also very good. They charge very quickly. These are also very easy to carry. These fit my ears perfectly but this might not be for everybody as they come in one size only. Also these are very comfortable .The ear detection works 100% of the time, making this a joy to use with apple devices. The tap commands on the AirPods also work great. But the AirPods  are neither noise cancelling nor water resistant. I have not used these with android so cannot comment on that.

"I have been using this airpods since a month and writing my review now i really like how it paired with iphone not tried with any other phone yet. Frankly its a delicate product i dont know about the durability. Sound quality is good come on its apple and you are paying 12k, but it could have been better with more bass. Battery life is pretty decent but one side of the airpod gets discharge fast then both i dont know its a faulty product or it happens with everyone. For noise cancellation i haven’t check properly while on calling other side of the person i didnt find any problem while talking through airpods. And for music noise cancellation is decent i wont say very good but decent it is. Now talk about stratches even if you put in your pocket gently you can see scratches after few uses. I dont know about silicon cases available and selling on amazon works well or not because i didnt try. Also i dont like to put apple products with cases. Finally in your initial days of using u will feel irritating after long use i would say 2 3 hours of continous use. Pro tip: moisterize your ears with  good moisterizer (little quantity) if your are planning to use for long. Ok guys thats it for now i hope this review will others to choose this product.

Battery life is good, it easily lasts for 3 hours & if AirPods battery is low put it in the case for 10 mins it again gains 70-80%.

"Got it this morning and in complete awe of them. This is a pocket size powerhouse. The sound output is insanely good. Wasn't expecting it to be so good, the sound doesn't get distorted even on max volume. They are small, good looking and extremely handy to use. Bluetooth pairing is as easy as it can be. The charging pod is simplistic yet elegant. Got it for 11k by using SBI card. They're practically a steal at the price. 10/10 recommend.

"Works like a dream. Almost no connectivity issues - very intuitive to use.Sound quality is pretty decent. However it has issues with noise isolation and it’s almost impossible to use in the middle of traffic for example.It’s pretty durable, I’ve had doubts about the durability of the case. Especially because of the small size, but I haven’t had any reason to worry so far.Pretty decent battery life. It’s not as good as my larger over-ear headphones but given the size it’s good. Using it for max of an hour a day, I end up charging it once in two weeks or so.Would I say it’s value for money? No.But if you need a small, easy to carry wireless earphones - this is a pretty good experience. It’s worth it for me.

"I had been meaning to purchase this product for a long time. The delivery took some time but in the end I got it safe and sound. Packaging was done all right. It’s original. The sound quality is good. As I am an existing apple user with 4-5 apple products at home, the AirPods gets synced with all the other products. So connection with them becomes a breeze. The distance is okay. The best thing I have used it in gym and it works flawlessly. It doesn’t fall out of ear while running. It just sticks to your ear. The only issue I find that the sound leaks out of it on increasing the volume.And the most important part, it gets dirty! It’s a dirt magnet. Like even if you don’t use it it gets dirty.I have to referred to some YouTube videos in order to clean my AirPods.Even if you’re a android user, go for it. I have tried it on pixel 2 and it works flawlessly.Rest I leave it on you.

"I don’t think there is any difference between the sound of ear pods or air pods, battery life is very good and pod case is too good. U can track ur airpods also on find my iphone app. I often take bike from metro station to my office which is hardly 5 minutes but the airpods do not fall off. Siri works fine. I think there should be some function to increase the volume bcoz either u have to use ur fone or siri to increror decrease the volume. All in all a good product. I cannot say must buy but yes i am satisfied with the product.

"Amazing product as expected. I'm using it with my Android phone more than iPhone. Excellent coverage, noise cancellation and sound quality. Truly wireless. It takes a little longer to set it up on Android devices, you need to push the button behind the case while setting up on Bluetooth. Once set, works like a charm. Some features are not available on Android, e.g. when you remove the airpods from your ears, music does not stop automatically. Not a deal breaker issue.I strongly recommend this product for use with both iPhone and Android devices.

"Dont buy it from amazon and its seller like Appario Retail Private Ltd.

"This is the second time i have purchased the airpods. My wife was so impressed with my earpods that i couldn't stop myself gifting her one. This is the best portable wireless earbuds you can have. Looks little costly for the Indian (myself, one) buyers but if you can stretch your budget don't give a second thought. Base is good, connectivity is top notch. Quite durable, great battery life. Casual music is good. For serious music capability i use my Sony xM1000 (that costs 30K). If i compare Sony and airpods, later is worth the money. Airpods have no match for its price and music capabilities. Cheers!

"when I compare apple AirPods with my Bose soundsport, frankly speaking apple does not hold its ground. But then apple is not a Bose when it comes to earphones, headphones or speakers.Having said that, apple is known for its design and perfection and AirPods look really classy. Sound quality is decent and also have a decent battery life (could be improved on both the fronts though).Fit could have been made a bit better. While Bose soundsport is perfect for gym and outdoor activities, AirPods are not exactly suitable for those.
