"The iPad is brand new and it's considerably bigger than my previous iPad mini 2. The functions are buttery smooth. My main purpose of gaming is easily met. I have installed asphalt 9 and PUBG and playing without any lag for hours.Only problem I faced is the left corner of the screen shows a yellow tint. I read on the internet about it. It's because of the glue that sticks the screen together. It will fade away with time. Mine is started getting faded.I bought it in great Indian festive sale with effective price of 18990. This is in my opinion the best deal for an iPad with this specifications.

"Verdict: iPad 6th generation (2018) is a nice tablet with great hardware and software. For most of us, perhaps this is the best choice for a tablet. The only real competitor of this tablet is the iPad 10.5&#34;, which has better hardware but is much more expensive.Following is my detailed review of iPad 6th generation (2018):Hardware:--------------------No surprises here. Apple always makes great devices.- Build quality is good.- Touchscreen is excellent.- Front and back cameras are good but not exceptional.- Sound quality is decent, but it could have been better.- Battery backup is good.- Touch id works fine.- Improved CPU and GPU enhance the overall responsiceness of Apps (especially games)Software:--------------------iOS is simply outstanding. Software is the primary reason I purchase Apple devices. My device already had iOS 11.3 installed out of the box.Things I noticed in iOS 11:1. The dock at the bottom of the screen, which looks similar to the dock of macOS.2. Control center design has improved.3. App store has been revamped. Personally, I liked the simplicity of the old app store better.4. The software keyboard design has changed.What's included in the box:--------------------Only two accessories are included in the box:- A 10w charger- A lightening to usb cable.They have not even provided earphones:).Apple pencil is NOT included in the box.If you want one, then you will need to purchase separately which will cost you INR 7.5K. I did NOT purchase the apple pencil. I didn't want to spend this much money for the pencil and I don't think I would have used it much even if I had purchased one.Which variant did I choose:--------------------32 GB, Wifi only, Space Grey.32 GB: It is more than sufficient for my requirements. If you store lots of data then consider the 128GB variant.WiFi only: I have limited use case of 4G model and so I didn't want to spend extra 10K for 4G model.Space grey: I like black bezels. I find white bezels little bit distracting.Accessories I purchased:--------------------The only accessory I purchased is the Spigen Tough Armor Case. This case is good, but it is a somewhat heavy.Shipping and packaging:--------------------I purchased this device from seller &#34;Appario Retail Private Ltd&#34;. I ordered the device in the morning and I received in the evening. This was super-fast. The packaging was great.What are the alternatives of this iPad:--------------------There is hardly any choice if you want to buy a tablet. I think the closest competitor of this particular model is the 10.5&#34; iPad pro which is very costly as compared to this.Why did I purchase:--------------------I already have a 4th generation iPad which I purchased in 2013. My experience with this iPad has been great. Apple provided software updates on this device till last year (2017), which is amazing.So why did a purchase a new one? The old iPad still works fine but it doesn't get software updates anymore. In my opinion, it is best to move away from a device in which you do not get security updates.What do I use iPad for:--------------------I use iPad primarily for content consumption and not for conent creation. For example I don't compose long emails or edit videos on my iPad. I also don't use the camera of iPad much.I use iPad for:Watching videos: On Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime VideosWeb surfing: I use both Safari and Chrome. I like the &#34;reader view&#34; mode of SafariGames:Should you buy a new iPad:--------------------In my opinion, if you already have an iPad in which you are getting software updates then you should perhaps not buy a new one.If you want one and don’t already have one, then you can consider this. Except for the much more expensive iPad pro 10.5”, this is the best tablet currently available.Let me know if you have any queries.

"Bought it for a Higher price 27K. Now its 23K. I bought it for Portrait painting 'cause it would be the cheapest ever display tablet (considering the price of the Apple Pencil) Besides that Screen looks Good, Battery is good most of the times (8000mAh btw) no heating whatsoever, speakers are good and it has headphone jack. Bad thing is it has the worst camera in any apple product. Its a really good buy if you are a newbie in digital and it is a great start for it.

"You must be here looking for if it’s genuine or not and issues like that! Well I got this iPad from Appario in the great Indian Sale. It cost me 20k and I couldn’t be more happier and grateful! I’ve had no issues with the genuineness of this iPad... no display or charging or any issue. Getting this powerful device in 20k is just nothing but a great opportunity! There’s nothing that’ll give this kind of performance and battery life in 20k. Sure even if you’re not getting it at that price I’d recommend still go for it because there’s no con to having this in your hand!Coming to the iPad performance, I’ve had no issues playing PUBG and other graphic intensive games for hours on end. I got this for gaming and writing purposes which it’s fulfilling wonderfully! The display is large and awesome! It plays HEVC x265 formats as well easily ! I’d also recommend the ESR screen tempered glass and MOCA covers which go along great with this tablet! Using this device is such a pleasure because of its speed and everything else!FYI: I upgraded from iPad mini 1

"I was looking for an Android Tablet to replace my ageing Nexus 7 2013 (running Nougat 7.1 via LineageOS) - the tablet served me well for more than 5 years - now it has become a little slow, and the battery is weakUnfortunately there is hardly any choice in the Android tablets world - The Leveno Tab4 8 Plus seemed good - but is stuck on Android 7.1 and no clear update paths. Stable custom ROMs are also hard to find given the lack on interest in Android tabletsSamsung's Tab S4 is great - but expensive - with maybe two major updates at the most. The Tab A 10.5 is overpriced - 30k for a SD450 based tablet - with a standard TFT screen (Not even IPS it seems)MI has some great Tablets - but these are not available in India - one will need to import it via AliExpress or GearBestGiven the crazy pricing of Apple's iPhones (and products in general) - the pricing of this tablet was a pleasant surprise.Pros:* Value for money - one of the best offerings in this price range - much better than Samsung* Expect iOS updates for next 3-4 years at least* Bright and vibrant IPS screen* Good battery life* Lag free* Good choice of accessories like Tempered glasses, cases etc available online* Headphone jack is present (thank god!)Cons:* Uses the older A10 chip - though it chugs along happily for regular tasks like media consumption, browsing etc* Single internal speaker - my Nexus 7 2013 has much better stereo speakers - useful for watching movies etc* Tied up the the Apple Ecosystem (Won't matter for many!)

I thoght of going with the pro version but later decided to go with this one as I didn't needed those extra features, just for books, sketching ang music. This works amazing and have superb response unlike android tabs. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough and I experienced no lag even while running 23 apps simuntaneously. Surely the best tablet you can get under 40k.

RAM management is on another level, never felt like I'm working with just a 2 Gigs of ramCons: camera 8MP + 1.2MP f2.4, seriously, 1.2MP camera in 2018!?1st Gen Touch ID and iOS for iPad, nothing much can be done on any iPad s not just this model! Comes under con since apple claims that ipad can be your laptop replacement!Being restricted by software on so many places, hope iOS 13 will be revolutionary!

"Let’s be serious, nobody needs an iPad.. It’s more of a want than a need and this is ideal for all causal internet browsing and Netflix or any movies.. Got one for my dad in 2017 after his laptop crashed and couldn’t resist getting myself one too.. The battery backup is just amazing and no other tablet comes closer to this thing.. The seemless data transfer is you have an iPhone or Mac makes it a breeze to use.. Yes it isn’t as fancy as an iPad Pro like there is a gap between the screen and the glass but I don’t know what the hype is about, after a day of usage you will never notice that.. The processor is fast for almost Games and more than enough for browsing or movies.. When compared to an iPad Pro the sound and the camera are definitely not at par but for 20k I don’t expect everything.. If you want decent computing power for daily usage this is ideal and for speakers just get a Bluetooth speaker, will give a better immersive experience for movie/ videos.. Also I feel the bezels though large helps me hold this thing without covering parts of the screen.. Seriously speaking after using it for over 2 months I feel anything more powerful is an overkill as I never felt this thing slowed down or crashed.. Also my dad uses the 2017 iPad which is still running smooth as brand new so m sure this will be as good as that.. Overall I feel it’s a good buy if you are looking for something for casual surfing and light gaming and also ideal for parents as in my case..

It's because of the glue that sticks the screen together. It will fade away with time. Mine is started getting faded.I bought it in great Indian festive sale with effective price of 18990. This is in my opinion the best deal for an iPad with this specifications.

"Verdict: iPad 6th generation (2018) is a nice tablet with great hardware and software. For most of us, perhaps this is the best choice for a tablet. The only real competitor of this tablet is the iPad 10.5&#34;, which has better hardware but is much more expensive.Following is my detailed review of iPad 6th generation (2018):Hardware:--------------------No surprises here. Apple always makes great devices.- Build quality is good.- Touchscreen is excellent.- Front and back cameras are good but not exceptional.- Sound quality is decent, but it could have been better.- Battery backup is good.- Touch id works fine.- Improved CPU and GPU enhance the overall responsiceness of Apps (especially games)Software:--------------------iOS is simply outstanding. Software is the primary reason I purchase Apple devices. My device already had iOS 11.3 installed out of the box.Things I noticed in iOS 11:1. The dock at the bottom of the screen, which looks similar to the dock of macOS.2. Control center design has improved.3. App store has been revamped. Personally, I liked the simplicity of the old app store better.4. The software keyboard design has changed.What's included in the box:--------------------Only two accessories are included in the box:- A 10w charger- A lightening to usb cable.They have not even provided earphones:).Apple pencil is NOT included in the box.If you want one, then you will need to purchase separately which will cost you INR 7.5K. I did NOT purchase the apple pencil. I didn't want to spend this much money for the pencil and I don't think I would have used it much even if I had purchased one.Which variant did I choose:--------------------32 GB, Wifi only, Space Grey.32 GB: It is more than sufficient for my requirements. If you store lots of data then consider the 128GB variant.WiFi only: I have limited use case of 4G model and so I didn't want to spend extra 10K for 4G model.Space grey: I like black bezels. I find white bezels little bit distracting.Accessories I purchased:--------------------The only accessory I purchased is the Spigen Tough Armor Case. This case is good, but it is a somewhat heavy.Shipping and packaging:--------------------I purchased this device from seller &#34;Appario Retail Private Ltd&#34;. I ordered the device in the morning and I received in the evening. This was super-fast. The packaging was great.What are the alternatives of this iPad:--------------------There is hardly any choice if you want to buy a tablet. I think the closest competitor of this particular model is the 10.5&#34; iPad pro which is very costly as compared to this.Why did I purchase:--------------------I already have a 4th generation iPad which I purchased in 2013. My experience with this iPad has been great. Apple provided software updates on this device till last year (2017), which is amazing.So why did a purchase a new one? The old iPad still works fine but it doesn't get software updates anymore. In my opinion, it is best to move away from a device in which you do not get security updates.What do I use iPad for:--------------------I use iPad primarily for content consumption and not for conent creation. For example I don't compose long emails or edit videos on my iPad. I also don't use the camera of iPad much.I use iPad for:Watching videos: On Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime VideosWeb surfing: I use both Safari and Chrome. I like the &#34;reader view&#34; mode of SafariGames:Should you buy a new iPad:--------------------In my opinion, if you already have an iPad in which you are getting software updates then you should perhaps not buy a new one.If you want one and don’t already have one, then you can consider this. Except for the much more expensive iPad pro 10.5”, this is the best tablet currently available.Let me know if you have any queries.

I bought it for Portrait painting 'cause it would be the cheapest ever display tablet (considering the price of the Apple Pencil) Besides that Screen looks Good, Battery is good most of the times (8000mAh btw) no heating whatsoever, speakers are good and it has headphone jack.

I’ve had no issues with the genuineness of this iPad... no display or charging or any issue. Getting this powerful device in 20k is just nothing but a great opportunity! There’s nothing that’ll give this kind of performance and battery life in 20k. Sure even if you’re not getting it at that price I’d recommend still go for it because there’s no con to having this in your hand!Coming to the iPad performance, I’ve had no issues playing PUBG and other graphic intensive games for hours on end. I got this for gaming and writing purposes which it’s fulfilling wonderfully! The display is large and awesome! It plays HEVC x265 formats as well easily ! I’d also recommend the ESR screen tempered glass and MOCA covers which go along great with this tablet! Using this device is such a pleasure because of its speed and everything else!FYI: I upgraded from iPad mini 1

"I was looking for an Android Tablet to replace my ageing Nexus 7 2013 (running Nougat 7.1 via LineageOS) - the tablet served me well for more than 5 years - now it has become a little slow, and the battery is weakUnfortunately there is hardly any choice in the Android tablets world - The Leveno Tab4 8 Plus seemed good - but is stuck on Android 7.1 and no clear update paths. Stable custom ROMs are also hard to find given the lack on interest in Android tabletsSamsung's Tab S4 is great - but expensive - with maybe two major updates at the most. The Tab A 10.5 is overpriced - 30k for a SD450 based tablet - with a standard TFT screen (Not even IPS it seems)MI has some great Tablets - but these are not available in India - one will need to import it via AliExpress or GearBestGiven the crazy pricing of Apple's iPhones (and products in general) - the pricing of this tablet was a pleasant surprise.Pros:* Value for money - one of the best offerings in this price range - much better than Samsung* Expect iOS updates for next 3-4 years at least* Bright and vibrant IPS screen* Good battery life* Lag free* Good choice of accessories like Tempered glasses, cases etc available online* Headphone jack is present (thank god!)Cons:* Uses the older A10 chip - though it chugs along happily for regular tasks like media consumption, browsing etc* Single internal speaker - my Nexus 7 2013 has much better stereo speakers - useful for watching movies etc* Tied up the the Apple Ecosystem (Won't matter for many!)

"Let’s be serious, nobody needs an iPad.. It’s more of a want than a need and this is ideal for all causal internet browsing and Netflix or any movies.. Got one for my dad in 2017 after his laptop crashed and couldn’t resist getting myself one too.. The battery backup is just amazing and no other tablet comes closer to this thing.. The seemless data transfer is you have an iPhone or Mac makes it a breeze to use.. Yes it isn’t as fancy as an iPad Pro like there is a gap between the screen and the glass but I don’t know what the hype is about, after a day of usage you will never notice that.. The processor is fast for almost Games and more than enough for browsing or movies.. When compared to an iPad Pro the sound and the camera are definitely not at par but for 20k I don’t expect everything.. If you want decent computing power for daily usage this is ideal and for speakers just get a Bluetooth speaker, will give a better immersive experience for movie/ videos.. Also I feel the bezels though large helps me hold this thing without covering parts of the screen.. Seriously speaking after using it for over 2 months I feel anything more powerful is an overkill as I never felt this thing slowed down or crashed.. Also my dad uses the 2017 iPad which is still running smooth as brand new so m sure this will be as good as that.. Overall I feel it’s a good buy if you are looking for something for casual surfing and light gaming and also ideal for parents as in my case..

"I wish the screen was a laminated display. Just to make things clear the visible gap comes in play only with Apple pencil and it does bother me sometimes. But if you want to make great arts but tight on budget, go for this one. Along with the Apple pencil it's a bang for bucks. There is no input lag for the pencil (Adobe sketch / notebility / procreate ). So need not worry for that. If you are looking at this to game on, also a good choice. I play PUBG on it sometimes and sometimes for a long time and the performance is really good. To be honest you will notice some frame drops once you set everything to the max. The battery life really impressed me. Didn't regret and I'm sure that you will also not.

"Let’s be serious, nobody needs an iPad.. It’s more of a want than a need and this is ideal for all causal internet browsing and Netflix or any movies.. Got one for my dad in 2017 after his laptop crashed and couldn’t resist getting myself one too.. The battery backup is just amazing and no other tablet comes closer to this thing.. The seemless data transfer is you have an iPhone or Mac makes it a breeze to use.. Yes it isn’t as fancy as an iPad Pro like there is a gap between the screen and the glass but I don’t know what the hype is about, after a day of usage you will never notice that.. The processor is fast for almost Games and more than enough for browsing or movies.. When compared to an iPad Pro the sound and the camera are definitely not at par but for 20k I don’t expect everything.. If you want decent computing power for daily usage this is ideal and for speakers just get a Bluetooth speaker, will give a better immersive experience for movie/ videos.. Also I feel the bezels though large helps me hold this thing without covering parts of the screen.. Seriously speaking after using it for over 2 months I feel anything more powerful is an overkill as I never felt this thing slowed down or crashed.. Also my dad uses the 2017 iPad which is still running smooth as brand new so m sure this will be as good as that.. Overall I feel it’s a good buy if you are looking for something for casual surfing and light gaming and also ideal for parents as in my case..

"Verdict: iPad 6th generation (2018) is a nice tablet with great hardware and software. For most of us, perhaps this is the best choice for a tablet. The only real competitor of this tablet is the iPad 10.5&#34;, which has better hardware but is much more expensive.Following is my detailed review of iPad 6th generation (2018):Hardware:--------------------No surprises here. Apple always makes great devices.- Build quality is good.- Touchscreen is excellent.- Front and back cameras are good but not exceptional.- Sound quality is decent, but it could have been better.- Battery backup is good.- Touch id works fine.- Improved CPU and GPU enhance the overall responsiceness of Apps (especially games)Software:--------------------iOS is simply outstanding. Software is the primary reason I purchase Apple devices. My device already had iOS 11.3 installed out of the box.Things I noticed in iOS 11:1. The dock at the bottom of the screen, which looks similar to the dock of macOS.2. Control center design has improved.3. App store has been revamped. Personally, I liked the simplicity of the old app store better.4. The software keyboard design has changed.What's included in the box:--------------------Only two accessories are included in the box:- A 10w charger- A lightening to usb cable.They have not even provided earphones:).Apple pencil is NOT included in the box.If you want one, then you will need to purchase separately which will cost you INR 7.5K. I did NOT purchase the apple pencil. I didn't want to spend this much money for the pencil and I don't think I would have used it much even if I had purchased one.Which variant did I choose:--------------------32 GB, Wifi only, Space Grey.32 GB: It is more than sufficient for my requirements. If you store lots of data then consider the 128GB variant.WiFi only: I have limited use case of 4G model and so I didn't want to spend extra 10K for 4G model.Space grey: I like black bezels. I find white bezels little bit distracting.Accessories I purchased:--------------------The only accessory I purchased is the Spigen Tough Armor Case. This case is good, but it is a somewhat heavy.Shipping and packaging:--------------------I purchased this device from seller &#34;Appario Retail Private Ltd&#34;. I ordered the device in the morning and I received in the evening. This was super-fast. The packaging was great.What are the alternatives of this iPad:--------------------There is hardly any choice if you want to buy a tablet. I think the closest competitor of this particular model is the 10.5&#34; iPad pro which is very costly as compared to this.Why did I purchase:--------------------I already have a 4th generation iPad which I purchased in 2013. My experience with this iPad has been great. Apple provided software updates on this device till last year (2017), which is amazing.So why did a purchase a new one? The old iPad still works fine but it doesn't get software updates anymore. In my opinion, it is best to move away from a device in which you do not get security updates.What do I use iPad for:--------------------I use iPad primarily for content consumption and not for conent creation. For example I don't compose long emails or edit videos on my iPad. I also don't use the camera of iPad much.I use iPad for:Watching videos: On Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime VideosWeb surfing: I use both Safari and Chrome. I like the &#34;reader view&#34; mode of SafariGames:Should you buy a new iPad:--------------------In my opinion, if you already have an iPad in which you are getting software updates then you should perhaps not buy a new one.If you want one and don’t already have one, then you can consider this. Except for the much more expensive iPad pro 10.5”, this is the best tablet currently available.Let me know if you have any queries.

I'd suggest you to buy it along with the pencil( only if you have some extra cash with you).. it's good for jotting notes and it will make you go absolutely paper less ( ecofriendly, right?)

I don’t know why people are saying the camera is bad coz after using it for 10 days I can say that it’s comparable to my iPhone 6s Plus camera.Ps : The charger you get with the device is 10W , so if you own an iPhone it’s a bonus as you can fast charge your phone�

"The best tablet possible. I feel since most people find Android phones easier and even cheaper to use, so if one wants to work heavily on a mobile device then the best option would be an ipad.

"You must be here looking for if it’s genuine or not and issues like that! Well I got this iPad from Appario in the great Indian Sale. It cost me 20k and I couldn’t be more happier and grateful! I’ve had no issues with the genuineness of this iPad... no display or charging or any issue. Getting this powerful device in 20k is just nothing but a great opportunity! There’s nothing that’ll give this kind of performance and battery life in 20k. Sure even if you’re not getting it at that price I’d recommend still go for it because there’s no con to having this in your hand!Coming to the iPad performance, I’ve had no issues playing PUBG and other graphic intensive games for hours on end. I got this for gaming and writing purposes which it’s fulfilling wonderfully! The display is large and awesome! It plays HEVC x265 formats as well easily ! I’d also recommend the ESR screen tempered glass and MOCA covers which go along great with this tablet! Using this device is such a pleasure because of its speed and everything else!FYI: I upgraded from iPad mini 1

"I was looking for an Android Tablet to replace my ageing Nexus 7 2013 (running Nougat 7.1 via LineageOS) - the tablet served me well for more than 5 years - now it has become a little slow, and the battery is weakUnfortunately there is hardly any choice in the Android tablets world - The Leveno Tab4 8 Plus seemed good - but is stuck on Android 7.1 and no clear update paths. Stable custom ROMs are also hard to find given the lack on interest in Android tabletsSamsung's Tab S4 is great - but expensive - with maybe two major updates at the most. The Tab A 10.5 is overpriced - 30k for a SD450 based tablet - with a standard TFT screen (Not even IPS it seems)MI has some great Tablets - but these are not available in India - one will need to import it via AliExpress or GearBestGiven the crazy pricing of Apple's iPhones (and products in general) - the pricing of this tablet was a pleasant surprise.Pros:* Value for money - one of the best offerings in this price range - much better than Samsung* Expect iOS updates for next 3-4 years at least* Bright and vibrant IPS screen* Good battery life* Lag free* Good choice of accessories like Tempered glasses, cases etc available online* Headphone jack is present (thank god!)Cons:* Uses the older A10 chip - though it chugs along happily for regular tasks like media consumption, browsing etc* Single internal speaker - my Nexus 7 2013 has much better stereo speakers - useful for watching movies etc* Tied up the the Apple Ecosystem (Won't matter for many!)

"Verdict: iPad 6th generation (2018) is a nice tablet with great hardware and software. For most of us, perhaps this is the best choice for a tablet. The only real competitor of this tablet is the iPad 10.5&#34;, which has better hardware but is much more expensive.Following is my detailed review of iPad 6th generation (2018):Hardware:--------------------No surprises here. Apple always makes great devices.- Build quality is good.- Touchscreen is excellent.- Front and back cameras are good but not exceptional.- Sound quality is decent, but it could have been better.- Battery backup is good.- Touch id works fine.- Improved CPU and GPU enhance the overall responsiceness of Apps (especially games)Software:--------------------iOS is simply outstanding. Software is the primary reason I purchase Apple devices. My device already had iOS 11.3 installed out of the box.Things I noticed in iOS 11:1. The dock at the bottom of the screen, which looks similar to the dock of macOS.2. Control center design has improved.3. App store has been revamped. Personally, I liked the simplicity of the old app store better.4. The software keyboard design has changed.What's included in the box:--------------------Only two accessories are included in the box:- A 10w charger- A lightening to usb cable.They have not even provided earphones:).Apple pencil is NOT included in the box.If you want one, then you will need to purchase separately which will cost you INR 7.5K. I did NOT purchase the apple pencil. I didn't want to spend this much money for the pencil and I don't think I would have used it much even if I had purchased one.Which variant did I choose:--------------------32 GB, Wifi only, Space Grey.32 GB: It is more than sufficient for my requirements. If you store lots of data then consider the 128GB variant.WiFi only: I have limited use case of 4G model and so I didn't want to spend extra 10K for 4G model.Space grey: I like black bezels. I find white bezels little bit distracting.Accessories I purchased:--------------------The only accessory I purchased is the Spigen Tough Armor Case. This case is good, but it is a somewhat heavy.Shipping and packaging:--------------------I purchased this device from seller &#34;Appario Retail Private Ltd&#34;. I ordered the device in the morning and I received in the evening. This was super-fast. The packaging was great.What are the alternatives of this iPad:--------------------There is hardly any choice if you want to buy a tablet. I think the closest competitor of this particular model is the 10.5&#34; iPad pro which is very costly as compared to this.Why did I purchase:--------------------I already have a 4th generation iPad which I purchased in 2013. My experience with this iPad has been great. Apple provided software updates on this device till last year (2017), which is amazing.So why did a purchase a new one? The old iPad still works fine but it doesn't get software updates anymore. In my opinion, it is best to move away from a device in which you do not get security updates.What do I use iPad for:--------------------I use iPad primarily for content consumption and not for conent creation. For example I don't compose long emails or edit videos on my iPad. I also don't use the camera of iPad much.I use iPad for:Watching videos: On Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime VideosWeb surfing: I use both Safari and Chrome. I like the &#34;reader view&#34; mode of SafariGames:Should you buy a new iPad:--------------------In my opinion, if you already have an iPad in which you are getting software updates then you should perhaps not buy a new one.If you want one and don’t already have one, then you can consider this. Except for the much more expensive iPad pro 10.5”, this is the best tablet currently available.Let me know if you have any queries.

"The best tablet possible. I feel since most people find Android phones easier and even cheaper to use, so if one wants to work heavily on a mobile device then the best option would be an ipad.

"You must be here looking for if it’s genuine or not and issues like that! Well I got this iPad from Appario in the great Indian Sale. It cost me 20k and I couldn’t be more happier and grateful! I’ve had no issues with the genuineness of this iPad... no display or charging or any issue. Getting this powerful device in 20k is just nothing but a great opportunity! There’s nothing that’ll give this kind of performance and battery life in 20k. Sure even if you’re not getting it at that price I’d recommend still go for it because there’s no con to having this in your hand!Coming to the iPad performance, I’ve had no issues playing PUBG and other graphic intensive games for hours on end. I got this for gaming and writing purposes which it’s fulfilling wonderfully! The display is large and awesome! It plays HEVC x265 formats as well easily ! I’d also recommend the ESR screen tempered glass and MOCA covers which go along great with this tablet! Using this device is such a pleasure because of its speed and everything else!FYI: I upgraded from iPad mini 1

"I was looking for an Android Tablet to replace my ageing Nexus 7 2013 (running Nougat 7.1 via LineageOS) - the tablet served me well for more than 5 years - now it has become a little slow, and the battery is weakUnfortunately there is hardly any choice in the Android tablets world - The Leveno Tab4 8 Plus seemed good - but is stuck on Android 7.1 and no clear update paths. Stable custom ROMs are also hard to find given the lack on interest in Android tabletsSamsung's Tab S4 is great - but expensive - with maybe two major updates at the most. The Tab A 10.5 is overpriced - 30k for a SD450 based tablet - with a standard TFT screen (Not even IPS it seems)MI has some great Tablets - but these are not available in India - one will need to import it via AliExpress or GearBestGiven the crazy pricing of Apple's iPhones (and products in general) - the pricing of this tablet was a pleasant surprise.Pros:* Value for money - one of the best offerings in this price range - much better than Samsung* Expect iOS updates for next 3-4 years at least* Bright and vibrant IPS screen* Good battery life* Lag free* Good choice of accessories like Tempered glasses, cases etc available online* Headphone jack is present (thank god!)Cons:* Uses the older A10 chip - though it chugs along happily for regular tasks like media consumption, browsing etc* Single internal speaker - my Nexus 7 2013 has much better stereo speakers - useful for watching movies etc* Tied up the the Apple Ecosystem (Won't matter for many!)

"Let’s be serious, nobody needs an iPad.. It’s more of a want than a need and this is ideal for all causal internet browsing and Netflix or any movies.. Got one for my dad in 2017 after his laptop crashed and couldn’t resist getting myself one too.. The battery backup is just amazing and no other tablet comes closer to this thing.. The seemless data transfer is you have an iPhone or Mac makes it a breeze to use.. Yes it isn’t as fancy as an iPad Pro like there is a gap between the screen and the glass but I don’t know what the hype is about, after a day of usage you will never notice that.. The processor is fast for almost Games and more than enough for browsing or movies.. When compared to an iPad Pro the sound and the camera are definitely not at par but for 20k I don’t expect everything.. If you want decent computing power for daily usage this is ideal and for speakers just get a Bluetooth speaker, will give a better immersive experience for movie/ videos.. Also I feel the bezels though large helps me hold this thing without covering parts of the screen.. Seriously speaking after using it for over 2 months I feel anything more powerful is an overkill as I never felt this thing slowed down or crashed.. Also my dad uses the 2017 iPad which is still running smooth as brand new so m sure this will be as good as that.. Overall I feel it’s a good buy if you are looking for something for casual surfing and light gaming and also ideal for parents as in my case..

"I wish the screen was a laminated display. Just to make things clear the visible gap comes in play only with Apple pencil and it does bother me sometimes. But if you want to make great arts but tight on budget, go for this one. Along with the Apple pencil it's a bang for bucks. There is no input lag for the pencil (Adobe sketch / notebility / procreate ). So need not worry for that. If you are looking at this to game on, also a good choice. I play PUBG on it sometimes and sometimes for a long time and the performance is really good. To be honest you will notice some frame drops once you set everything to the max. The battery life really impressed me. Didn't regret and I'm sure that you will also not.

"You must be here looking for if it’s genuine or not and issues like that! Well I got this iPad from Appario in the great Indian Sale. It cost me 20k and I couldn’t be more happier and grateful! I’ve had no issues with the genuineness of this iPad... no display or charging or any issue. Getting this powerful device in 20k is just nothing but a great opportunity! There’s nothing that’ll give this kind of performance and battery life in 20k. Sure even if you’re not getting it at that price I’d recommend still go for it because there’s no con to having this in your hand!Coming to the iPad performance, I’ve had no issues playing PUBG and other graphic intensive games for hours on end. I got this for gaming and writing purposes which it’s fulfilling wonderfully! The display is large and awesome! It plays HEVC x265 formats as well easily ! I’d also recommend the ESR screen tempered glass and MOCA covers which go along great with this tablet! Using this device is such a pleasure because of its speed and everything else!FYI: I upgraded from iPad mini 1

"I was looking for an Android Tablet to replace my ageing Nexus 7 2013 (running Nougat 7.1 via LineageOS) - the tablet served me well for more than 5 years - now it has become a little slow, and the battery is weakUnfortunately there is hardly any choice in the Android tablets world - The Leveno Tab4 8 Plus seemed good - but is stuck on Android 7.1 and no clear update paths. Stable custom ROMs are also hard to find given the lack on interest in Android tabletsSamsung's Tab S4 is great - but expensive - with maybe two major updates at the most. The Tab A 10.5 is overpriced - 30k for a SD450 based tablet - with a standard TFT screen (Not even IPS it seems)MI has some great Tablets - but these are not available in India - one will need to import it via AliExpress or GearBestGiven the crazy pricing of Apple's iPhones (and products in general) - the pricing of this tablet was a pleasant surprise.Pros:* Value for money - one of the best offerings in this price range - much better than Samsung* Expect iOS updates for next 3-4 years at least* Bright and vibrant IPS screen* Good battery life* Lag free* Good choice of accessories like Tempered glasses, cases etc available online* Headphone jack is present (thank god!)Cons:* Uses the older A10 chip - though it chugs along happily for regular tasks like media consumption, browsing etc* Single internal speaker - my Nexus 7 2013 has much better stereo speakers - useful for watching movies etc* Tied up the the Apple Ecosystem (Won't matter for many!)

"Let’s be serious, nobody needs an iPad.. It’s more of a want than a need and this is ideal for all causal internet browsing and Netflix or any movies.. Got one for my dad in 2017 after his laptop crashed and couldn’t resist getting myself one too.. The battery backup is just amazing and no other tablet comes closer to this thing.. The seemless data transfer is you have an iPhone or Mac makes it a breeze to use.. Yes it isn’t as fancy as an iPad Pro like there is a gap between the screen and the glass but I don’t know what the hype is about, after a day of usage you will never notice that.. The processor is fast for almost Games and more than enough for browsing or movies.. When compared to an iPad Pro the sound and the camera are definitely not at par but for 20k I don’t expect everything.. If you want decent computing power for daily usage this is ideal and for speakers just get a Bluetooth speaker, will give a better immersive experience for movie/ videos.. Also I feel the bezels though large helps me hold this thing without covering parts of the screen.. Seriously speaking after using it for over 2 months I feel anything more powerful is an overkill as I never felt this thing slowed down or crashed.. Also my dad uses the 2017 iPad which is still running smooth as brand new so m sure this will be as good as that.. Overall I feel it’s a good buy if you are looking for something for casual surfing and light gaming and also ideal for parents as in my case..

But if you want to make great arts but tight on budget, go for this one. Along with the Apple pencil it's a bang for bucks. There is no input lag for the pencil (Adobe sketch / notebility / procreate ). So need not worry for that. If you are looking at this to game on, also a good choice. I play PUBG on it sometimes and sometimes for a long time and the performance is really good. To be honest you will notice some frame drops once you set everything to the max.

"Verdict: iPad 6th generation (2018) is a nice tablet with great hardware and software. For most of us, perhaps this is the best choice for a tablet. The only real competitor of this tablet is the iPad 10.5&#34;, which has better hardware but is much more expensive.Following is my detailed review of iPad 6th generation (2018):Hardware:--------------------No surprises here. Apple always makes great devices.- Build quality is good.- Touchscreen is excellent.- Front and back cameras are good but not exceptional.- Sound quality is decent, but it could have been better.- Battery backup is good.- Touch id works fine.- Improved CPU and GPU enhance the overall responsiceness of Apps (especially games)Software:--------------------iOS is simply outstanding. Software is the primary reason I purchase Apple devices. My device already had iOS 11.3 installed out of the box.Things I noticed in iOS 11:1. The dock at the bottom of the screen, which looks similar to the dock of macOS.2. Control center design has improved.3. App store has been revamped. Personally, I liked the simplicity of the old app store better.4. The software keyboard design has changed.What's included in the box:--------------------Only two accessories are included in the box:- A 10w charger- A lightening to usb cable.They have not even provided earphones:).Apple pencil is NOT included in the box.If you want one, then you will need to purchase separately which will cost you INR 7.5K. I did NOT purchase the apple pencil. I didn't want to spend this much money for the pencil and I don't think I would have used it much even if I had purchased one.Which variant did I choose:--------------------32 GB, Wifi only, Space Grey.32 GB: It is more than sufficient for my requirements. If you store lots of data then consider the 128GB variant.WiFi only: I have limited use case of 4G model and so I didn't want to spend extra 10K for 4G model.Space grey: I like black bezels. I find white bezels little bit distracting.Accessories I purchased:--------------------The only accessory I purchased is the Spigen Tough Armor Case. This case is good, but it is a somewhat heavy.Shipping and packaging:--------------------I purchased this device from seller &#34;Appario Retail Private Ltd&#34;. I ordered the device in the morning and I received in the evening. This was super-fast. The packaging was great.What are the alternatives of this iPad:--------------------There is hardly any choice if you want to buy a tablet. I think the closest competitor of this particular model is the 10.5&#34; iPad pro which is very costly as compared to this.Why did I purchase:--------------------I already have a 4th generation iPad which I purchased in 2013. My experience with this iPad has been great. Apple provided software updates on this device till last year (2017), which is amazing.So why did a purchase a new one? The old iPad still works fine but it doesn't get software updates anymore. In my opinion, it is best to move away from a device in which you do not get security updates.What do I use iPad for:--------------------I use iPad primarily for content consumption and not for conent creation. For example I don't compose long emails or edit videos on my iPad. I also don't use the camera of iPad much.I use iPad for:Watching videos: On Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime VideosWeb surfing: I use both Safari and Chrome. I like the &#34;reader view&#34; mode of SafariGames:Should you buy a new iPad:--------------------In my opinion, if you already have an iPad in which you are getting software updates then you should perhaps not buy a new one.If you want one and don’t already have one, then you can consider this. Except for the much more expensive iPad pro 10.5”, this is the best tablet currently available.Let me know if you have any queries.

"Not as smooth a UI as I've come to expect from previous models. Battery life could have been better. Apple's premium pricing for base specs brings some expectations with it - this was an average experience.

"6 months later review:Pros: Powerful A10 Fusion quad core processer, great battery life, Apple pencil support. RAM management is on another level, never felt like I'm working with just a 2 Gigs of ramCons: camera 8MP + 1.2MP f2.4, seriously, 1.2MP camera in 2018!?1st Gen Touch ID and iOS for iPad, nothing much can be done on any iPad s not just this model! Comes under con since apple claims that ipad can be your laptop replacement!Being restricted by software on so many places, hope iOS 13 will be revolutionary!

"Let’s be serious, nobody needs an iPad.. It’s more of a want than a need and this is ideal for all causal internet browsing and Netflix or any movies.. Got one for my dad in 2017 after his laptop crashed and couldn’t resist getting myself one too.. The battery backup is just amazing and no other tablet comes closer to this thing.. The seemless data transfer is you have an iPhone or Mac makes it a breeze to use.. Yes it isn’t as fancy as an iPad Pro like there is a gap between the screen and the glass but I don’t know what the hype is about, after a day of usage you will never notice that.. The processor is fast for almost Games and more than enough for browsing or movies.. When compared to an iPad Pro the sound and the camera are definitely not at par but for 20k I don’t expect everything.. If you want decent computing power for daily usage this is ideal and for speakers just get a Bluetooth speaker, will give a better immersive experience for movie/ videos.. Also I feel the bezels though large helps me hold this thing without covering parts of the screen.. Seriously speaking after using it for over 2 months I feel anything more powerful is an overkill as I never felt this thing slowed down or crashed.. Also my dad uses the 2017 iPad which is still running smooth as brand new so m sure this will be as good as that.. Overall I feel it’s a good buy if you are looking for something for casual surfing and light gaming and also ideal for parents as in my case..

"Battery life is very good. I use it to take notes, annotate research papers and do some creative work like pictures for my personal website. For moderate use it lasts upto 2 days.Screen quality is good for reading. Video quality is awesome.It is a no distraction device !

"Used it for almost a month now, Great Product for Productive personal and office use, Apple Pencil writing experience is brilliant, you feel as if you are writing on Paper Book. Good for e-reading. Butter smooth 2gb is like 4gb. Audio output is less but not a problem you can use Bluetooth Speakers or Headphone. Battery life is very good. Take the cover while buying it and also put tempered glass.

"Safari browser is the only browser which can save PDF generated by websites properly. Firefox saves a blank pdf. Chrome can’t save pdf. But Microsoft EDGE browser can save pdf but replaces pdf file’s original name with website name.So poor 3rd party app support and no proper file manager by Apple. ��‍♂️While gaming 3D graphics heavy games temp doesn’t goes up even after 30 mins. But while using Augmented reality (AR) in camera for measurement of 3D objects, temp shoots up immediately.Around 21gb is free out of 32gb which is enough. Also 5gb iCloud storage is free.

"Love the iPad. It's extremely fast and super fluid. The product is amazing in every way - the screen,  processor and build quality. That said, iOS is a mixed bag. UI is really good but lacks customisation like Android. With Android, I can make the product adapt to my workflow. iOS is rigid on that regard. I bought it for screen quality and it's held up in that department to my expectation.

"BATTERY IiFE COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER GAMING IS JUST AMAZING PUBG AND OTHER GAMES RUNS BUTTERY SMOOTH BUILD QUALITY IS ALSO GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE LAMINATED DISPLAY BUT AT THIS PRICE RANGE WITH A10CPU IT'S ABSOLUTELY OKK WITH ME.

"I wish the screen was a laminated display. Just to make things clear the visible gap comes in play only with Apple pencil and it does bother me sometimes. But if you want to make great arts but tight on budget, go for this one. Along with the Apple pencil it's a bang for bucks. There is no input lag for the pencil (Adobe sketch / notebility / procreate ). So need not worry for that. If you are looking at this to game on, also a good choice. I play PUBG on it sometimes and sometimes for a long time and the performance is really good. To be honest you will notice some frame drops once you set everything to the max. The battery life really impressed me. Didn't regret and I'm sure that you will also not.

"Excellent tablet from Apple i.e, iPad for Students... With great features...
            ",positive
"Works great for general purposes but if you're a gamer looking to buy this to play graphic and memory intensive games like PUBG then this is probably not the device you want to go for. I switched from OnePlus 5t to this for gaming and let me tell you the performance is nowhere close. 5t beats this device by a longshot.

"I was over the top of the mountain when I got this and was pretty sure it would be a NETFLIX device only but after buying the apple pencil and a Bluetooth keyboard it has really reduced my need to even open a laptop. I use it all the time to take notes, Netflix and chill and sometimes create presentation for school on the Microsoft apps.

"The iPad has a great battery life, screen is as good as any Retina display. Storage space is a major issue, always go for the higher storage space as the base model just fills up with 15-20 apps. iOS is fabulous as always, great for binge watching on the go.
