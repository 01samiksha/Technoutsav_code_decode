"This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

"This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English

"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).

"Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... �

Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

"This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

"I got it on sale for 3k. For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.

"I bought 3rd gen Echo Dot.... here are some pros and cons:Pro's.1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.3. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT4. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying.....

"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.-Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.-Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.-Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).-Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.-Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.-Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.-Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion-If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!- Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.

"Overall a good product with lots of skills that u can add. Easy to install and  start and looks so perfect. It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.

"I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.

"An incredible technology interface brought by Amazon. It's still our first week and I must say its has become an interface for me to enjoy the music across era's , create my own playlists, for my young kids to listen to stories and learning and improving general / world knowledge and learning different languages, for my mother to enjoy spiritual music while my better half getting amused how a kid of 4 years to elders in family all enjoy such a technology marvel all at the same time.

"Great Device, I'm still learning what Dot can do. Easy and fun to use, it Tells you everything, bad part it will not play recent news, or live news, more issues while connecting the device from Bluetooth, sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini..some times it says 'can't find it on the web'!!! I think there is a lot of improvement needed ..Need prime membership to play good songs, all songs are not available.... unable to play YouTube...best part of Alexa is that she can set multiple alarms and reminders. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc. Hope Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills...

"At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

"It’s jus beyond awesome.����� I thought dot is bit small so the sound quality may affect due to size but really it’s really a beast. The sound system is jus beyond my expectations in one room the sound to the full volume is very loud.Pros: I have syska led smart bulb too which works wonder wid this amazon dot.It’s also works with fire tv stick.Sound quality is jus fab.Look wise it’s beautifulCan be commanded being in different room.Cons:Cannot take multiple instructions especially when u r operating wid fire stick.Please don’t take a second thought to buy this beauty.I got this for 3k in amazon great festival.

"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

"What an amazing product? A must have for all home. Spend some more money in the smart home accessories and you can use its full power. At its price point it is the best speaker available in the market. However if you have any costly speaker system in your home connect it wirelessly . I use my BOSE speaker system quite seamlessly.

It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well.

"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).

"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.-Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.-Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.-Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).-Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.-Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.-Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.-Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion-If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!- Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.

"Overall a good product with lots of skills that u can add. Easy to install and  start and looks so perfect. It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.

"I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.

"At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.

The major difference between second generation and third generation echo dot is.. the sound which is very high in echo dot and also it has 5 microphones so even if the music is loud alexa work can be heard easily.

It uses 15 volt power.. while car battery provides 12 volt power.. don't know if the car battery can support the power requirement.. 2). Probably,  the power lead that comes with this product is not USB type universal charger that I was expecting from it. 3). I don't the speaker is that great.. the sound emanating from is high on bass, I would have preferred Amazon allowing us to mix the quality preferred by me.. they should have added this feature in Alexa, since it boasts to have the world at your feet.Amazon probably would add these feature in their next generation.. but I feel cheated as I preferred to have it in the product that I brought.. not that the technology does not exists.. the sad part is that it does.. but corporation like Amazon will like milk their  customer dry

So my verdicts.Total devices i ve: 6Total duration: 2 yearsVerdict: -they say its better than previous gen. Bit to be honest, its not that good in hearing your voice as 2nd gen do. I am having trouble making it listening.-  led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.- more asthetic look. I liked it.- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.CONCLUSIVE: Its addition of money and new device. From users perspective i al ok with earlier. If u recin budget go for second gen.

"I'm a tech-savvy guy, I own both Google Home Mini & Echo Dot 3rd gen.Bought this on Great Indian sale for just 2999/- only.Reviewing it after 2 weeks of using it.Okay, my first thought was how much Alexa is suitable for the Indian Audience. Ans? Totally worth it.Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.Do you need to have a Prime subscription?This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:Play music loud.Can respond to your queries very well.Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).Shop from Amazon Pantry.Disadvantages:Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.It does not support gaana appAlexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.

So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.-Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.-Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).-Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.-Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.-Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.-Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion-If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!- Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.

"Overall a good product with lots of skills that u can add. Easy to install and  start and looks so perfect. It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.

"I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.

Easy and fun to use, it Tells you everything, bad part it will not play recent news, or live news, more issues while connecting the device from Bluetooth, sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini..some times it says 'can't find it on the web'!!! I think there is a lot of improvement needed ..Need prime membership to play good songs, all songs are not available.... unable to play YouTube...best part of Alexa is that she can set multiple alarms and reminders. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc. Hope Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills...

"At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.

"I got this product delivered on 10th october and was launched on 11october. What a great delivery. The major difference between second generation and third generation echo dot is.. the sound which is very high in echo dot and also it has 5 microphones so even if the music is loud alexa work can be heard easily. At 2999 introduction priceIts a steal deal. Did lot of stuff like booking pkayed quiz beside playing only songs.

Probably,  the power lead that comes with this product is not USB type universal charger that I was expecting from it. 3). I don't the speaker is that great.. the sound emanating from is high on bass, I would have preferred Amazon allowing us to mix the quality preferred by me.. they should have added this feature in Alexa, since it boasts to have the world at your feet.Amazon probably would add these feature in their next generation.. but I feel cheated as I preferred to have it in the product that I brought.. not that the technology does not exists.. the sad part is that it does.. but corporation like Amazon will like milk their  customer dry

"Not so great on sound quality. Feature wise same. But yes, i feel that in 3rd gen they have reduced mics to 4 instead of 7 in 2nd gen. So my verdicts.Total devices i ve: 6Total duration: 2 yearsVerdict: -they say its better than previous gen. Bit to be honest, its not that good in hearing your voice as 2nd gen do. I am having trouble making it listening.-  led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.- more asthetic look. I liked it.- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.CONCLUSIVE: Its addition of money and new device. From users perspective i al ok with earlier. If u recin budget go for second gen.

"I'm a tech-savvy guy, I own both Google Home Mini & Echo Dot 3rd gen.Bought this on Great Indian sale for just 2999/- only.Reviewing it after 2 weeks of using it.Okay, my first thought was how much Alexa is suitable for the Indian Audience. Ans? Totally worth it.Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.Do you need to have a Prime subscription?This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:Play music loud.Can respond to your queries very well.Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).Shop from Amazon Pantry.Disadvantages:Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.It does not support gaana appAlexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.

So, need to connect the device with your phone.

Its kind of very irritating at times. Only my 5yrs old daughter was interested and wide eyed when Alexa spoke. lolI will start with Cons--You need to keep it plugged as it has no supportive battery.You need to keep repeating question like a parrot until Alexa understandsYou need to keep adding apps for alexa to function and that too does not work properlyAlexa does not recognise your playlist, Its not programmed that way, So even if your have list full of songs it will not play.Alexa only knows Savan and Amazon music which has very limited collection of songs.Now comes for the storytelling and other activities, It keeps repeating the same story and same jokes, same poems.

"This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well.

"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).

You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion.

Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.-Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.-Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.-Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).-Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.-Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.-Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.-Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion-If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!- Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.

It's still our first week and I must say its has become an interface for me to enjoy the music across era's , create my own playlists, for my young kids to listen to stories and learning and improving general / world knowledge and learning different languages, for my mother to enjoy spiritual music while my better half getting amused how a kid of 4 years to elders in family all enjoy such a technology marvel all at the same time. Experience it, explore it  and enjoy it... everyday.

"Great Device, I'm still learning what Dot can do. Easy and fun to use, it Tells you everything, bad part it will not play recent news, or live news, more issues while connecting the device from Bluetooth, sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini..some times it says 'can't find it on the web'!!! I think there is a lot of improvement needed ..Need prime membership to play good songs, all songs are not available.... unable to play YouTube...best part of Alexa is that she can set multiple alarms and reminders. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc. Hope Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills...

"At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.

"I got this product delivered on 10th october and was launched on 11october. What a great delivery. The major difference between second generation and third generation echo dot is.. the sound which is very high in echo dot and also it has 5 microphones so even if the music is loud alexa work can be heard easily. At 2999 introduction priceIts a steal deal. Did lot of stuff like booking pkayed quiz beside playing only songs.

It uses 15 volt power.. while car battery provides 12 volt power.. don't know if the car battery can support the power requirement.. 2). Probably,  the power lead that comes with this product is not USB type universal charger that I was expecting from it. 3). I don't the speaker is that great.. the sound emanating from is high on bass, I would have preferred Amazon allowing us to mix the quality preferred by me.. they should have added this feature in Alexa, since it boasts to have the world at your feet.Amazon probably would add these feature in their next generation.. but I feel cheated as I preferred to have it in the product that I brought.. not that the technology does not exists.. the sad part is that it does.. but corporation like Amazon will like milk their  customer dry

"Not so great on sound quality. Feature wise same. But yes, i feel that in 3rd gen they have reduced mics to 4 instead of 7 in 2nd gen. So my verdicts.Total devices i ve: 6Total duration: 2 yearsVerdict: -they say its better than previous gen. Bit to be honest, its not that good in hearing your voice as 2nd gen do. I am having trouble making it listening.-  led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.- more asthetic look. I liked it.- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.CONCLUSIVE: Its addition of money and new device. From users perspective i al ok with earlier. If u recin budget go for second gen.

"I'm a tech-savvy guy, I own both Google Home Mini & Echo Dot 3rd gen.Bought this on Great Indian sale for just 2999/- only.Reviewing it after 2 weeks of using it.Okay, my first thought was how much Alexa is suitable for the Indian Audience. Ans? Totally worth it.Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.Do you need to have a Prime subscription?This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:Play music loud.Can respond to your queries very well.Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).Shop from Amazon Pantry.Disadvantages:Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.It does not support gaana appAlexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.

Follow them and you are good to go. It just took me ten seconds and I am not very tech savvy.The only thing which I didn't like is that Alexa read out books only from Kindle unlimited or which I have bought from Amazon. It did not read my other documents aloud. It didn't recognize my other novels on my kindle. Hence I was a bit disappointed.On the whole a fun product.

Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well.

Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying.....

"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.-Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.-Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.-Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).-Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.-Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.-Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.-Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion-If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!- Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.

"Overall a good product with lots of skills that u can add. Easy to install and  start and looks so perfect. It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.

"I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.

"Great Device, I'm still learning what Dot can do. Easy and fun to use, it Tells you everything, bad part it will not play recent news, or live news, more issues while connecting the device from Bluetooth, sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini..some times it says 'can't find it on the web'!!! I think there is a lot of improvement needed ..Need prime membership to play good songs, all songs are not available.... unable to play YouTube...best part of Alexa is that she can set multiple alarms and reminders. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc. Hope Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills...

"At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.

The major difference between second generation and third generation echo dot is.. the sound which is very high in echo dot and also it has 5 microphones so even if the music is loud alexa work can be heard easily.

So my verdicts.Total devices i ve: 6Total duration: 2 yearsVerdict: -they say its better than previous gen. Bit to be honest, its not that good in hearing your voice as 2nd gen do. I am having trouble making it listening.-  led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.- more asthetic look. I liked it.- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.CONCLUSIVE: Its addition of money and new device. From users perspective i al ok with earlier. If u recin budget go for second gen.

"I'm a tech-savvy guy, I own both Google Home Mini & Echo Dot 3rd gen.Bought this on Great Indian sale for just 2999/- only.Reviewing it after 2 weeks of using it.Okay, my first thought was how much Alexa is suitable for the Indian Audience. Ans? Totally worth it.Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.Do you need to have a Prime subscription?This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:Play music loud.Can respond to your queries very well.Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).Shop from Amazon Pantry.Disadvantages:Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.It does not support gaana appAlexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.

Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).2.pretty loud for the sound .3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.4.robust design .5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .Cons:1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .4. Heats up a bit on the top .5.wifi coverage isn't the best .Well If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.Alexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features

It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it...

"I got it on sale for 3k. For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.

"I bought 3rd gen Echo Dot.... here are some pros and cons:Pro's.1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.3. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT4. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying.....

"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.-Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.-Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.-Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).-Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.-Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.-Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.-Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion-If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!- Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.

"Overall a good product with lots of skills that u can add. Easy to install and  start and looks so perfect. It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.

"I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.

"At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only

"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.

I am having trouble making it listening.-  led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.- more asthetic look. I liked it.- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.CONCLUSIVE: Its addition of money and new device.

"I'm a tech-savvy guy, I own both Google Home Mini & Echo Dot 3rd gen.Bought this on Great Indian sale for just 2999/- only.Reviewing it after 2 weeks of using it.Okay, my first thought was how much Alexa is suitable for the Indian Audience. Ans? Totally worth it.Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.Do you need to have a Prime subscription?This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:Play music loud.Can respond to your queries very well.Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).Shop from Amazon Pantry.Disadvantages:Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.It does not support gaana appAlexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.

"Why the single star...I am about practicality... it's not easy to configure alexa...very cumbersome process...Alexa app is quite slow...once configured to a wifi network...you cannot really configure to any other wifi...which means Alexa cannot be taken to other places other than your home. Commands cannot be configured easily. No way to configure your playlist. A playlist that exists in Amazon or Saavn is pathetic. No proper way to configure or use wifi that is available in public or your vacation places. The continuous power supply is required. Please don't waste your money on this better get Jarvis or wait till this improves a lot

" I have been 2 weeks since I am using it. I am fun using this device. Alexa is like part of our family. Even my grandmom enjoys it. Mostly I am using it for playing music. It is able to play almost all songs. It would be great if we are able to play youtube videos also. Looking forward to exploring more abilities. Hope amazon guys add more skills like compatibility with youtube and gaana.The sound is good in a room. Alexa can hear you from some distance also. Though there are issues while hearing when it's playing on full volume.

"Purchased a device for my home automation, and it screwed up. Frequently it's giving a distorted notice and getting restart automatically. Thought it might be due internet provider ACT fiber. But bluetooth had also been same issue after playing few songs and my mobile started playing on its own. Now I am going to return it. Looks a product issue.

"This is indeed an improvement over the 2nd gen. But, a lot needs to be done in the machine learning part. 8 out of 10 ttimes, it understands but not as good as Google Home. I saw one of the reviewers on here bashing other reviewers saying that most of them don't know about sound quality in speakers. I don't agree with that. I agree with others who say this has a good quality of bass. For the price, you get an AI powered speaker with powerful sound. Go for it. This purchase will not be regretted.

"This is the second Amazon Echo Dot I purchased within six months. I am very happy with the first one which is second generation model. This is bought for gifting purpose.

"So I wanted a device to control my smart home devices via my voice so I bought the echo do, I got a really good deal as I paid just 3.6k for it (The actual retail price is 4.5k).So i v already owned an Alexa for a while .And there are a lot of things that it can do but it also lacks in some places .Pro's:1. Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).2.pretty loud for the sound .3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.4.robust design .5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .Cons:1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .4. Heats up a bit on the top .5.wifi coverage isn't the best .Well If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.Alexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features

"Amazon has really worked hard on the this generation of the Echo. Comparing to the previous Gen 1 and Gen 2 , Gen 3 comes with a bang.It has a four microphones that will help you give command from anywhere of the room.The sound and bass of the speaker is mind blowing. This device has a built in woofer in it and it's really awesome. The sound quality is super and it's a treat to listen music from this speakers.With being said that Amazon provides huge range of skills to fulfill your needs. It can understand few words of Hindi and sometimes responds in Hindi ; which are sometimes funny and entertaining.There are built in skills like saavn and gaana to provide you songs you want to listen. Rest you can get from Amazon Prime Music.You can also use it like a bluetooth speaker and watch movies , trust me it sounds like dolby.All in all , great product if like new modern gadget then can go and buy this one ; it's really good.I fell in love with this product in day one.

"Upgraded from 2nd to 3rd Gen dot, must say the sound quality has improved phenomenally. While the previous gen dot was more of an ""Echo Input"" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog  and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)3. Spotify not available ""yet""4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.Summary:If you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now.

"I have been using the Alexa for about a month now. Following are the reasons for buying or not buying it:Why buy Alexa?-New tech, voice assistant feels you powerful.-Good acoustics. You can hear the songs from anywhere around your home.-Good for engineering purpose. You may hack it for your own bespoke purpose, for IOT applications.-Amazing new tech.Why I don't recommend buying Alexa?-It works wobbly when it comes to giving voice commands in between an ongoing music or action.-Does not work with Google Maps.-Serch engine is poor and limited too.-More expensive than it's counterpart, Google Home Mini.

Even though its better in terms of sound quality but it is still required to pay attention on better software.2.  A big gap in terms of software between google assistant and Alexa.

"This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well.

"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).

Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying.....

"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.-Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.-Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.-Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).-Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.-Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.-Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.-Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion-If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!- Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.

Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information.

"I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.

"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.

Totally worth it.Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.Do you need to have a Prime subscription?This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:Play music loud.Can respond to your queries very well.Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).Shop from Amazon Pantry.Disadvantages:Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.It does not support gaana appAlexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.

"I loved loved loved Alexa. She is super fun and understands most of what I say. Though there are some things which are foreign to her.Easy to install, easy to use. There are instructions given. Follow them and you are good to go. It just took me ten seconds and I am not very tech savvy.The only thing which I didn't like is that Alexa read out books only from Kindle unlimited or which I have bought from Amazon. It did not read my other documents aloud. It didn't recognize my other novels on my kindle. Hence I was a bit disappointed.On the whole a fun product.

"This new echo dot 3rd generation is what I wanted. This smart speaker is capable to play a good music in a large size room. Alexa is smart and quick enough to react on your command. The muisc and the bass is very well balanced for a soothing music experience.Also, music streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Muisc and Saavn are also available to play music from. So, need to connect the device with your phone. Instead ask Alexa to play any music, playist or album of your choice.However Aexa mobile app can be improved but that is nothing much to do with the amazing performance of this very device. Go for it guys, you won't regret it.

"While Alexa is smart and intelligent , it cannot answer complex questions because it does not have Google Search !Google mini has the brains of the best search engine on earth ! Google mini any day ! Only reason to buy it would be if you had a prime music account and you had to play music through it !

"There is nothing to dislike in 3 generation Echo Dot ! Everything about it is made to Perfection. The sound output is just splendid and I own Echo Plus and Echo Dot 2 generation. I regret to have bought the 2 generation Dot since the audio output is pathetic and needs a Bose Bluetooth speaker to do justice but in the case of Dot 3 generation the gadget delivers .... Go for it.

"Sadly, I had to return it. It felt like a speaker eventually. Nothing to add, Everything felt very processed, I had to ask Alexa  one thing and she keeps replying I don't know that. Its kind of very irritating at times. Only my 5yrs old daughter was interested and wide eyed when Alexa spoke. lolI will start with Cons--You need to keep it plugged as it has no supportive battery.You need to keep repeating question like a parrot until Alexa understandsYou need to keep adding apps for alexa to function and that too does not work properlyAlexa does not recognise your playlist, Its not programmed that way, So even if your have list full of songs it will not play.Alexa only knows Savan and Amazon music which has very limited collection of songs.Now comes for the storytelling and other activities, It keeps repeating the same story and same jokes, same poems. BORINGI could have gone on and on but then I returned it as I felt it does practically nothing other than rubbish.Pros-- Anticipation of something awesome... hahhahahhaThe cute buildI wish they upgrade more and make it more usable.

"I bought it from amazon great Indian sale for Rs.3000 and am totally happy with the device.• Sound quality more then what I expected.• Very good hardware.• Full premium look and feel.• 4 microphones don't fail you even in considerable noise around.• Lots of things to say to Alexa and you can add more skills using amazon echo application.• good bass.• You can even customize a few things like you can make the device listen to you by saying Computer or Echo instead of Alexa.•Even better if you have Amazon Prime subscription.• Supports bluetooth and has a audio jack.A product you won't regret. Am planning to buy another one.

"Must have product, got it for only 2999 and its awesome. At first I used bluetooth speakers worth Rs. 2000 then i thought why not spend 1000 more and Buy Alexa, and it really paid off.. it also works like a Bluetooth Speaker if not connected to internet, and once you connect it to wifi it becomes Smart Assistant which can control your smart devices or do many things.Sound out put is loud and has bass two, while color looks best for me and the ring sorroundinv body gives it better look. Its total worth it, Amazing Value for Money.

"Usually we see upgrade with next gen products but this seems to be downgrade for eco doc. I have used previous version which was much better than this one in terms of command recognition and accuracy of response. New eco dot is too far from accuracy and may lead to frustration while interacting with the device.It cannot recognise the books available on kindle library which is a very basic skill. It cannot recognise songs we request. Cannot play popular songs as well. Not sure what kind of advanced tasks it can perform when fail to do very basic tasks. Great disappointment.

"Amazing product, fortunate to pick this up during your Sale.  I already bought the Echo last year during its launch, I was keen to buy the Echo Connect but it was not launched in India, so bought this one at a price similar to what it would have costed me to buy the echo input (Wired connection)

"I was bit confused before buying as I was not sure what exactly it can do, gone through many reviews. Finally bought it and after using it for a month, writing this review.As it's running on artificial intelligence so do not expect it to answer as human. You have to say Alexa before every question which could be little annoying some times.What it can do?You can play songs for sure, ask questions and it answers you for most of the times, set alarm, alerts. create routine Etc.But I use it mostly for listing songs and alarms and does a good job.Only negative thing that I can say as of now is its bit difficult to give commands at higher volume you really have to shout but in normal it can pick thinest of sound.So all in all its value for money as I got it @2999 in sale.

"[1 & 1/2 months Review] Sound iQuality(Bass, Treble, mids)  are awesome for Music. Has no connection issues whatsoever. But is a terrible let down if looking for smart capabilities , mostly coz Alexa isn't as smart or conversive like the Google assistant. It's a smart speaker which isn't really smart. If your looking for music only that then go ahead,but then if your only looking for music go in for JBL or other Bluetooth speakers. Else go for Google home mini. Had to spend a lot of time making Alexa smart with combination of autovoice and tasker

"Hi Future buyer,Planning to buy this device wud be highly not recommended if u r a noob to this and in case u r running a custom rom on your andriod device.The App is confusing as much as it can be and force closes if u r not on factory OS, neither will there be any help or nor any reply to your mails from the developer, The setup dint go well and took me to register the product from web based registration.Otherwise the Product build quality is excellent when compared to the previous one and sound quality is amazing in the new one, Non the less Google home mini still has a better speaker but its hard to differentiate having both at my house side by side,You r also not to be surprised if u find your router to behave funny when both Alexa and Google home mini are side by side, Its like they r fighting for Bandwidth.The results are quite slow and takes time for reply when compared to G Home mini.The LED looks damn good at night and kinda adds upto the entire beauty of the productOverall if u r someone with good skill set on these things and just want to showoff ur house go for it I wud recommend to buy, others if u r a nood ( Fresher ) go for google home your life will be easy

"Alexa is very bad in searching things. It every time says ""Sorry I don't know"" bleakly. She even cannot tell about the search engine she uses. For your information, she using Bing. Yucks!There is only buzz for alexa while google home is far far superior than it. Very bad experience. I'm not at all amused by this.Rest of the things are at par with google home but google home wins in the end.And alexa ""Sorry I don't know"" but you're a garbage

"many times we still get the red LED with ""sorry i am haivng difficulty understanding, pls try after sometime"", so its not very stablequite a few pros, which u will see in other reviews, but one thing is that it doesnt have any battery backup, so have to hook it up to UPS and also its music services get lesser if amazon prime is not subscribed (no access to prime music then)

"Extremely overstated product in ads and otherwise. Has bare minimum that it can do as it has only prime music as a source of music. Doesn't understand most of the commands and doesn't have a huge number of songs which are very common, this makes choices extremely limited! Pairing is a serious pain on most occasions and thus isn't much user friendly either. Came free as a result of card usage else would have been hurting like anything. I feel Google speakers would be much better considering it's search is based on what's there on the internet rather than a perticular site or app! Using an android I know what Google assistant is capable off as compared to baby dumb Alexa!

"Why the single star...I am about practicality... it's not easy to configure alexa...very cumbersome process...Alexa app is quite slow...once configured to a wifi network...you cannot really configure to any other wifi...which means Alexa cannot be taken to other places other than your home. Commands cannot be configured easily. No way to configure your playlist. A playlist that exists in Amazon or Saavn is pathetic. No proper way to configure or use wifi that is available in public or your vacation places. The continuous power supply is required. Please don't waste your money on this better get Jarvis or wait till this improves a lot

" I have been 2 weeks since I am using it. I am fun using this device. Alexa is like part of our family. Even my grandmom enjoys it. Mostly I am using it for playing music. It is able to play almost all songs. It would be great if we are able to play youtube videos also. Looking forward to exploring more abilities. Hope amazon guys add more skills like compatibility with youtube and gaana.The sound is good in a room. Alexa can hear you from some distance also. Though there are issues while hearing when it's playing on full volume.

"This is indeed an improvement over the 2nd gen. But, a lot needs to be done in the machine learning part. 8 out of 10 ttimes, it understands but not as good as Google Home.

I agree with others who say this has a good quality of bass. For the price, you get an AI powered speaker with powerful sound. Go for it. This purchase will not be regretted.

"So I wanted a device to control my smart home devices via my voice so I bought the echo do, I got a really good deal as I paid just 3.6k for it (The actual retail price is 4.5k).So i v already owned an Alexa for a while .And there are a lot of things that it can do but it also lacks in some places .Pro's:1. Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).2.pretty loud for the sound .3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.4.robust design .5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .Cons:1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .4. Heats up a bit on the top .5.wifi coverage isn't the best .Well If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.Alexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features

"Amazon has really worked hard on the this generation of the Echo. Comparing to the previous Gen 1 and Gen 2 , Gen 3 comes with a bang.It has a four microphones that will help you give command from anywhere of the room.The sound and bass of the speaker is mind blowing. This device has a built in woofer in it and it's really awesome. The sound quality is super and it's a treat to listen music from this speakers.With being said that Amazon provides huge range of skills to fulfill your needs. It can understand few words of Hindi and sometimes responds in Hindi ; which are sometimes funny and entertaining.There are built in skills like saavn and gaana to provide you songs you want to listen. Rest you can get from Amazon Prime Music.You can also use it like a bluetooth speaker and watch movies , trust me it sounds like dolby.All in all , great product if like new modern gadget then can go and buy this one ; it's really good.I fell in love with this product in day one.

"Upgraded from 2nd to 3rd Gen dot, must say the sound quality has improved phenomenally. While the previous gen dot was more of an ""Echo Input"" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog  and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)3. Spotify not available ""yet""4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.Summary:If you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now.

Even though its better in terms of sound quality but it is still required to pay attention on better software.2.  A big gap in terms of software between google assistant and Alexa.

"Writing this review after about a month of use and I gotta say it is the best in the class in my point of view. I haven't used Google home mini so I can't make comparisons on its hardware.But software wise, Alexa is on par with Google assistant in India as well. Many devices such as Android TVs and smart bulbs support both Alexa and Google assistant without any issues.Bought this for ₹2999 on the Great Indian festival sale let me some up the pros when compared to 2nd gen echo dot1. There are 4 directional mics as compared to two on the 2nd gen which translates to better and increase range of response to your voice.2. More speakers and they now fire from all around the sides of the echo dot rather than the top which is more louder and clearer than the 2nd gen. They can't be compared to the bigger siblings at this price. It's good enough.3. It has a more rounded finish around the speakers and the top compared to the boxy construction of the 2nd gen. It also has a fabric finish around the speakers which feels  aesthetically good.Alexa lives in the cloud, so new features will come to all devices. It works with all the apps mentioned in the pics.Note: Change your preferred music service to Saavn in the Alexa app for a better experience. It has more songs than prime music

Amazing form factor and design, above average far-field speech recognition feature, and WHAT A SOUND!! One Star for extra only for the sound. Otherwise, the general Alexa capabilities are more or less the same across all Echo devices. The smart-home features are absolute fun to use too. Summing up, this device is a MUST BUY for music lovers, thanks to an unending list of accessible songs sourced through Amazon Music, Saavn and other 3rd party music streaming services. However, it would certainly take some time for general users in order to figure out how to optimally use the Dot and maximize Alexa's full capabilities - Amartya / Tech Reviewer
